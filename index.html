<h1>Hello! Thanks for dropping by. ðŸ˜ƒ</h1>

<h2>Fondo is the place to access, build and share the skills and ideas you need for tomorrow.</h2>
<p>

  <strong>Why?</strong><br>
- The world of work is changing much faster than our ability to learn and adapt<br>
- The internet has changed everything, but itâ€™s now become difficult for us to filter and understand what we need. This is getting harder as the world changes and we donâ€™t always know what to do next. If you lack access, privilege, signals or resources this is even harder still<br>
- Most education is passive and lacks personalization and group dynamics. And most of it is still pretty dry.<br>


<p>

<strong>What?</strong> <br>
- Short-form, impactful and interactive modules and guides across a range of key skills and topics.<br>
- From being a good board member, to understanding the principles of sustainability, learning how to manage your biases, and fine-tuning your public speaking.<br>
</p>
<p>

<strong>How?</strong><br> 
- Topics are bitesize, personalized, and curated by our global network of practitioners. Play games, collaborate, snack, explore.
</p>
<p>

<strong>Who?</strong><br> 
- At Fondo's core is a belief that great things happen in small groups: you can join a learning group, or work alongside a Fondo coach to progress towards your goals.<br>
- And if you want to share your expertise then join us as a Creator, Contributor or Coach to help bring amazing learning experiences to life!<br>

And if this was TL;DR? You could think of us like Duolingo (learning) meets Etsy (sharing) for your career.
