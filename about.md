## Some information and frequently asked Fondo questions...


### Why?
The internet has changed everything, but it’s now become difficult for us to filter and understand what we need. This is getting harder as the world changes and we don’t always know what to do next. If you lack access, privilege, signals or resources this is even harder still

Most education is passive and lacks personalization and group dynamics. And most of it is still pretty dry.

### What?
Short-form, impactful and interactive modules and guides across a range of key skills and topics.

From being understanding the principles of sustainability, learning how to manage your biases, and fine-tuning your public speaking.


### How?
Topics are bitesize, personalized, and curated by our global network of practitioners. Play games, collaborate, snack, explore.

Most content is free, but some is locked for premium members.

And if this was TL;DR? You could think of us like Duolingo (learning) meets Etsy (sharing) for your career.


### Who?
At Fondo's core is a belief that great things happen in small groups: you can join a learning group, or work alongside a Fondo coach to progress towards your goals.

And if you want to share your expertise then join us as a Creator, Contributor or Coach to help bring amazing learning experiences to life!
